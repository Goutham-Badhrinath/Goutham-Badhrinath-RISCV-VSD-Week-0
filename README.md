# Week 0 – My RISC-V SoC Tapeout Experience  

This repository records the activities completed during **Week 0** of my **10-week RISC-V SoC Tapeout journey**, organized by **VLSI System Design (VSD)** in collaboration with **IIT Gandhinagar**.  

---

## 🖥️ Program Intro  
The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** is an intensive 10-week hands-on training where participants design, simulate, and prepare a **RISC-V System-on-Chip (SoC)** for tapeout.  
The program emphasizes:  
- Gaining a solid understanding of **Digital VLSI Design Fundamentals**.  
- Learning how to use **Open-Source EDA Tools** such as **Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Yosys, OpenLane, OpenROAD**, and more.  
- Building practical knowledge of **ASIC flows** and chip-level verification.  
- Developing a systematic approach to **plan, implement, and validate a mini SoC project**.  

This repo specifically documents the work done in **Week 0**, covering both introductory learning and tool setup.
